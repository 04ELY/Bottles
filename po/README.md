# Help translating Bottles :rocket:
Help Bottles get translated in your language!

## Improve a translation :raising_hand:
If you've found typos or just think you can improve a translation, open a 
Pull request with the suggested changes or use the 
[GitLocalize](https://gitlocalize.com/repo/5547) platform.

Please, this is an open source, free, free project. Don't vandalize the 
translations, it's not funny, it's idiotic.

## Provide new translations
We use [GitLocalize](https://gitlocalize.com/repo/5547) as translation platform, 
just link your GitHub account and start translating!

Alternatively, clone the [bottles.pot](https://github.com/bottlesdevs/Bottles/blob/master/po/bottles.pot) 
in a new `.po` file with the same language code, e.g. for Italian 
translations, the file should be named `it.po`.

## Thanks! :two_hearts: :tada:
A heartfelt thanks to anyone who wants to help us get Bottles to speak any language!
