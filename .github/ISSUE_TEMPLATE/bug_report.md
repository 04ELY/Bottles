Please don't fill issue for a Windows executable that doesn't work in Bottles. Our software is a Wine prefix manager. If a Windows application doesn't work, it could be a Wine problem (**Wine is NOT a software developed by Bottles**) or a misconfiguration of the wineprefix (take a look at WineHQ: https://www.winehq.org) or ProtonDB: https://www.protondb.com for more information on the software you are trying to run). 

We will support the installation of Windows software, only through our official installers: https://github.com/bottlesdevs/Bottles/issues/55 (when these are ready).
Please DO NOT open issues for this reason. Issues should be used to report Bugs and request New Features for Bottles.
